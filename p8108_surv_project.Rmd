## Train Test Split
```{r}
set.seed(2022)

rotterdam_split <- initial_split(rotterdam, prop = 0.8, strata = death)
rotterdam_training <- training(rotterdam_split)
rotterdam_test <- testing(rotterdam_split)
```

## Perform 10-fold Cross-Validation  
The output contains 1 row for each fold/repeat. So, 10 folds * 5 repeats = 50
rows. The split_analysis column is a list column containing a data frame for
each row with 9 folds combined, and the split_assessment column is a list column 
containing a data frame for each row with 1 fold.
```{r}
set.seed(2022)

rotterdam_folds <- vfold_cv(rotterdam_training, v = 10, repeats = 5, 
                            strata = death)

rotterdam_folds <- rotterdam_folds %>%
  mutate(split_analysis = map(splits, analysis),
         split_assessment = map(splits, assessment))
```
