## Background

- We analyzed the Rotterdam data set from the `survival` package in R. This data includes `r nrow(rotterdam)` breast cancer patients from the Rotterdam tumor bank.
- Notable measurements include age, menopausal status, tumor size, number of effected lymph nodes, and other baseline variables.
- Interventions were hormone treatment and chemotherapy.
- Subjects were followed until death or loss to follow up with occurrences of remission and death being recorded.

```{r example slide table}
set.seed(2022)

rotterdam_split <- initial_split(rotterdam, prop = 0.8, strata = death)
rotterdam_training <- training(rotterdam_split)
rotterdam_test <- testing(rotterdam_split)

head(rotterdam_training, 5) %>% 
  select(-1) %>% 
  remove_rownames() %>% 
  knitr::kable() %>% 
  kableExtra::kable_styling(latex_options = "scale_down")
```

## Exploratory Analysis

>- Example: You can add arrows ">-"
>- and make bullet points
>- appear on subsequent slides

<!-- This is a comment that won't appear in the presentation -->

## Methods

- We can use code chunks to illustrate plots

```{r example plot}
rotterdam_training %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = age, y = dtime)) +
  geom_point()
```

## Methods

- Or you can also insert images like this (but the image dimensions have to be correct):
